## Self-study tool for quizbowl

### How to use
The UI itself is very simple - it contains a box that holds the question, which will be read out word by word, and the answer entry box. Enter your answer either
by manually pressing the 'enter' button or pressing the return key. 

This program does not require an internet connection - if you already have the html source of a specific quizdb page stored locally, you may just replace 'html.txt' 
within the program files with the source code. 

Stats are indicated by respective markers. One correct answer gives you 10 points, and an incorrect answer takes away 5 points.

To get a new set of questions, click the 'Get new set' button in the lower box. You will be directed to a quizdb page. Once you have chosen the parameters
for your questions, click the small window (probably labeled 'Tk #2') and click to return to your game. To restart your game with your new set of questions, click
'Restart with new'.
